<p>We are a partnership making Manchester a great place to grow older.</p>

<p>We are engaging communities, organisations and individuals with research, design and structural support to grow stronger together and reduce social isolation and loneliness.</p>

<p>This website is a work in progress, and will be added to as the project develops.</p>

<h2>What we're doing</h2>

<div class="box">
  <h3>Project Background</h3>
  <p>MAFN is based at Manchester Metropolitan University, in the School of Architecture. We specialise in community-engaged research practice, and have had our research described as "world class" by the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p>
  <p>Find out more about our academic background, and how we are connected to the World Health Organisation's <em>Age-Friendly Cities</em> programme.</p>

  <h3>Action Plans</h3>
  <p>We're working on publishing all our findings in an accessible, useful way, enabling people to come together to understand the problems facing their areas.</p>
  <p>From these plans we then make changes together on a variety of scales to make our neighbourhoods more Age Friendly.</p>

<div class="box">
  <h3>PlaceCal</h3>
  <p>We're setting up a revolutionary shared calendar to help organisations promote their events better, and make it easier to find out about things happening right near you.</p>
  <p>This project emerged to fill a community need as a direct result of our research. It is funded by CityVerve and supported by Manchester City Council.</p>
