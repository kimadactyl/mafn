<h2>What is an Action Plan?</h2>

<p>In each area we work in we create an Action Plan: a co-designed and co-researched report that helps us understand our neighbourhoods, together. These reports focus making our neighbourhoods better places for everyone to live by reducing social isolation.</p>

<p>The idea of the Action Plans is to open up our research process, enabling us to work together to make informed decisions about what interventions need to be made. These plans help communities tell us what matters to them in a range of areas such as transport, commerce, green space, public facilities, education, civic inclusion, and housing. They also help us understand the needs of older residents as a whole.</p>

<p>When the Action Plans are agreed, we then put them into practice together. This can mean anything from installing a disabled toilet in a community centre, to funding computer training for older people, to getting further funding for large infrastructure projects. These actions can be taken by MMU, the neighbourhood boards, residents, or organisations. Working together from design to creation to evaluation and back again, we can make truly impactful community interventions.</p>

<h2>Action Plan Workshops</h2>

<p>To help people understand the research we have done, we are delivering several Action Plan Workshops. In these, we will explain the work we are doing and give you a chance to tell us if we're on the right track (or not).</p>
