Age Friendly Hulme &amp; Moss Side is part of Manchester Age Friendly Neighbourhoods.

Manchester Age Friendly Neighbourhood team (MAFN) based in the Manchester School of Architecture at MMU in partnership with Southways Housing Trust. MAFN are a multi-disciplinary team of researchers, urban designers, a health and social care manager, architects and community development workers who will be co-researching with residents about how Age Friendly their neighbourhood is now and how to make it better.

A new resident-led Partnership has been set up in each neighbourhood to promote active ageing, increase older people’s participation and to make the neighbourhood more Age Friendly. We are going to be working with residents to create an Age-Friendly Action Plan which will develop activities and projects to make the neighbourhood more Age-Friendly.

MAFN are supported by a Steering Group which includes partners from Southways, Manchester City Council, Age Friendly Manchester, NHS/ CCG, MMU and representatives of each Neighbourhood Partnership Board.
